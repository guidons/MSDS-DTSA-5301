# NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report (CU Boulder MS-DS DTSA-5301)

## Goal
This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis and estimate a regression model to potentially explain some of the variance. This repository contains the submission for the course's final project (Project 1: NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report). 

## Data
This dataset details every shooting incident in NYC from 2006 to the end of the previous year, including event specifics, location, time, and suspect and victim demographics. The data is reviewed quarterly by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website.
